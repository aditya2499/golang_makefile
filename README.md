# Golang Makefile Example
## Getting started

```
// get project files
git clone git clone https://github.com/verybluebot/golang_makefile.git

```

Then `cd` into the project root directory and use to build binary file:
```
make all

```

Now you can go on and create your program using this as a template!

Or you can get only the makefile and use it in your project:
```
// using wget:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/verybluebot/golang_makefile/master/makefile

// using curl:
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/verybluebot/golang_makefile/master/makefile

```

Just dont forget to change the `EXENAME` varaible in the makefile to whatever name you called your main package
